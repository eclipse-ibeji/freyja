# In-Memory Mock Cloud Adapter

The In-Memory Mock Cloud Adapter mocks the behavior of the cloud connector from within the memory of the Freyja application. Data which is sent to this adapter will be printed to stdout. This enables a minimal example scenario when working with Freyja. This library contains an implementation of the `CloudAdapter` trait from the contracts.

## Config

This adapter requires no configuration.
