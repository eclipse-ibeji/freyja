# Mock Digital Twin

The Mock Digital Twin mocks the behavior of an in-vehicle digital twin service (such as Ibeji) and providers as a separate application. This enables functionality similar to the in-memory mock, but with finer control over the behavior of the mocked data.

## Configuration

This mock supports the following configuration:

- `digital_twin_server_authority`: The authority that will be used for hosting the mock digital twin service
- `entities`: A list of entities with the following properties:
  - `begin`: An integer indicating when to enable this entity (refer to [Behavior](#behavior) for more information on how this value is used)
  - `end`: An optional integer indicating when to disable this entity. Set to `null` if you never want the entity to "turn off" (refer to [Behavior](#behavior) for more information on how this value is used)
  - `entity`: Describes an entity that should be provided via the `find_by_id` API at some point during the application's lifecycle. The properties of this object are identical to those of the [In-Memory Mock Digital Twin Adapter](../../adapters/digital_twin/in_memory_mock_digital_twin_adapter/README.md) with the following modifications:
    - `protocol`: When using this service, this value should always be `http`
  - `values`: Defines the values that the entity's signal should take. This can take one of two forms:
    - `Static`: The signal's value is a constant, configured as a string
    - `Stepwise`: The signal's value will change, increasing and decreasing cyclically by a set value between and upper and lower bound. When using this setting the following additional configuration is required:
      - `start`: The starting value of the signal. This can be either the upper or lower bound.
      - `end`: The other bound for the signal value
      - `delta`: The amount to add to the signal value at each iteration. If this operation would exceed the specified bounds, then the signal value saturates at the boundary value.

This mock supports [config overrides](../../docs/tutorials/config-overrides.md). The override filename is `mock_digital_twin_config.json`, and the default config is located at `res/mock_digital_twin_config.default.json`.

## Behavior

This mock service mocks the behavior of both the Ibeji digital twin service and providers that register with it.

Entities that support the `Subscribe` operation will allow clients to subscribe, and the server will periodically publish the entity values to the provided callback. The communication protocol used by these mocked providers for this callback is gRPC and is compatible with the [Sample gRPC Data Adapter](../../adapters/data/sample_grpc_data_adapter/README.md).

Similarly, providers that support the `Get` operation will allow clients to request value with an "async get" operation. The server will publish the entity values a single time to the provided callback rather than setting up a recurring callback. If the client wishes to retrieve the values again, then the client would need to send another request.

This mock maintains a count of the number of times the value of entity has been requested, and returns a value that is a function of this count. In this way, the behavior of the `generate_signal_value()` API is identical to that of the In-Memory Data Adapter.

## Build and Run

The Mock Digital Twin supports two modes: interactive and non-interactive.

### Non-Interactive Mode

Non-interactive mode is the default behavior of this application. To run the Mock Digital Twin in non-interactive mode, run the following command:

```shell
cargo run -p mock-digital-twin
```

In non-interactive mode, the `begin` and `end` properties in the config are ignored, and all configured entities are always exposed in the mock's APIs.

### Interactive Mode

To use interactive mode with the Mock Digital Twin, pass the `--interactive` flag when running the application:

```shell
cargo run -p mock-digital-twin -- --interactive
```

In interactive mode, the application maintains an internal count, and only entities satisfying the condition `begin <= count [< end]` will be enabled for all APIs. To increment this count and potentially change the set of enabled entities, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the application's console. This allows manual control over when the entities are turned on or off and permits straightforward mocking of more complex scenarios. As a result of this behavior, it is recommended to write configs such that a state change happens each time <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pressed. For example, if a mock scenario has `n` different desired states, then all numbers in the range `0..n-1` should appear as values for at least one `begin` or `end` property. Otherwise pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will sometimes have no effect.

**Do not use interactive mode if running this service in a container!** This feature is not compatible with containers and will cause unexpected behavior, including very high resource consumption.
