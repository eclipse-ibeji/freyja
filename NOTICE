      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      * "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      * "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
        version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

        writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      * "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
        behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  *  2.Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
    Object form. 
  * 3.Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in

    those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
    License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
    filed. 
  * 4.Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
    in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: 
      * (a)You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and 
      * (b)You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and 
      * (c)You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and 
      * (d)If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
        a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
        file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
        Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

  *  5.Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
    Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
    any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
    you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
  * 6.Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
  * 7.Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
    Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
  * 8.Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
    tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages. 
  * 9.Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
    or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications. 

2.    THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
3.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a.     DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in applications you develop if you comply with the terms below.
i.      Right to Use and Distribute.
·        You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.

·        Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications.

ii.     Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
·        use the Distributable Code in your applications and not as a standalone distribution;

·        require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement; and

·        indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified Distributable Code.

iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not
·        use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or

·        modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.

4.    DATA.
a.     Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
b.    Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.
5.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
·        work around any technical limitations in the software;

·        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;

·        remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

·        use the software in any way that is against the law; or

·        share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.  
7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
9.    APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

(ii)       Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
